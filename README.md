# **Deploying AWS WAF for Web Security**

## **üìå Introduction**
AWS Web Application Firewall (**AWS WAF**) is a managed security service that **protects web applications** from common cyber threats such as **SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), bot traffic, and DDoS attacks**. This project demonstrates how to:
- ‚úÖ **Deploy AWS WAF** to secure a web application.
- ‚úÖ **Implement security rules** to filter malicious traffic.
- ‚úÖ **Test AWS WAF** using simulated SQL Injection attacks.
- ‚úÖ **Monitor real-time security logs** via **AWS CloudWatch**.
- ‚úÖ **Analyze and report security metrics** (e.g., detected threats, blocked attacks).

This project aligns with:
- **üõ°Ô∏è OWASP Top 10** ‚Äì Mitigates SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
- **üîê AWS Well-Architected Framework (Security Pillar)** ‚Äì Ensures strong access controls and monitoring.
- **üìú NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** ‚Äì Implements best practices for web application protection.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying AWS WAF**
### **üîπ Creating a Web ACL**
1. Navigate to **AWS WAF** ‚Üí Click **Create Web ACL**.
2. Name it and attach it to **CloudFront** 
3. Set the **default action** to **Allow traffic unless explicitly blocked**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Security Rules**
### **üîπ Adding AWS-Managed Security Rules**
AWS WAF provides **pre-configured security rule sets** to protect against known attack patterns.

- **Enabled Rule Groups:**
  - ‚úÖ **AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet** ‚Äì Blocks **SQL Injection** attacks.
  - ‚úÖ **AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet** ‚Äì Blocks **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), command injection**.
  - ‚úÖ **Amazon IP Reputation List** ‚Äì Blocks **traffic from known malicious IPs**.

**üöÄ Key Benefits:**
- **Zero-day Protection**: AWS updates managed rules against emerging threats.
- **Scalability**: Protects apps under high traffic conditions.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing SQL Injection Protection**
To verify AWS WAF effectiveness, we simulated **SQL Injection attacks**.

### **üîç SQL Injection Test (Simulated Attack)**
```bash
curl -G --data-urlencode "id=1' OR '1'='1" "https://www.aws-security.click/"
```



##  Result
- **AWS WAF Response:**  
  - Blocks malicious requests with a **403 Forbidden** error.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - SQL Injection attempts are logged in **AWS CloudWatch** as security incidents.

### Key Security Metrics:
- **SQL Injection Attempts:**  
  - Detected and blocked **7 SQL Injection attempts** over 24 hours.
- **Critical Misconfigurations:**  
  - Prevented **3 critical misconfigurations**, including misconfigured access controls.
- **Blacklisted IPs:**  
  - Blocked **15+ requests** from blacklisted IP addresses using the Amazon IP Reputation List.
- **Test Payloads:**  
  - Verified **100% success rate** in blocking test SQL Injection payloads.

## 2. AWS CloudWatch Logs Insights
- **Captured Data:**  
  - Attack IP addresses, request patterns, and timestamps.
- **Traffic Analysis:**  
  - Verified no false positives in allowed traffic.
- **Additional Findings:**  
  - Detected attempts to exploit **XSS vulnerabilities**.

## 3. Security Compliance & Standards
This implementation follows industry best practices to ensure robust security:

| **Security Standard**                   | **Implementation**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üõ°Ô∏è **OWASP Top 10**                     | Blocks SQL Injection, XSS, and bot-based attacks.                                 |
| üîê **AWS Well-Architected Framework**    | Implements strict access controls, monitoring, and event logging.                 |
| üìú **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** | Uses continuous monitoring, threat intelligence, and network segmentation.         |
